## 🚀 Deploy to GitHub Pages

**Enable Pages** in repo settings → **Deploy from branch

> No build pipeline needed – it’s pure HTML/CSS/JS.

## 🖌️ Customising

* **Brand colours** → edit CSS vars at the top of each HTML file.
* **Habits / phases** → just change the `<div class="habit-item">` blocks or table rows.
* **Add a page** → drop a new `.html`, then add a card link in `index.html`.

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs are welcome for:

* Accessibility tweaks (ARIA labels, keyboard nav, colour contrast).
* Performance micro‑optimisations (minified CSS, async fonts).
* Additional language versions.
